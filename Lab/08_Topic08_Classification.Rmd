```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This week's Rmd file here: <https://github.com/MaRo406/EDS_231-text-sentiment/blob/main/topic_8.Rmd>

```{r packages, include = FALSE}
library(here)
library(tidytext)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(textrecipes) #create modeling recipes
library(discrim) # naive-bayes
library(here)
```

This data set includes more *possible* predictors than the text alone, but for this model we will only use the text variable

```{r data,}
#download data spreadsheet here: #https://drive.google.com/file/d/1936GbWMjswqrOJuKfwik5vNmd0N4hPGF/view?usp=sharing

incidents_df <- read.csv(here("Lab/data/climbing_reports_model_dat.csv"))

glimpse(incidents_df)
```

Now we'll split our data into training and test portions

```{r split-data}
set.seed(1234)

incidents2class <- incidents_df %>%
  mutate(fatal = factor(if_else(
    is.na(Deadly) ,
    "non-fatal", "fatal")))


incidents_split <- initial_split(incidents2class, strata = fatal)

incidents_train <- training(incidents_split)
incidents_test <- testing(incidents_split)

```

We use recipe() to initialize our preprocessing transformations,specifying the predictor and outcome variables and the data.

```{r recipe}
incidents_rec <- recipe(fatal ~ Text, data = incidents_train)
```

Next we add some familiar pre-processing steps on our Text variable: tokenize to word level, filter to the most common words, and calculate tf-idf.

```{r pre-process}
recipe <- incidents_rec %>%
  step_tokenize(Text) %>%
  step_tokenfilter(Text, max_tokens = 1000) %>%
  step_tfidf(Text) 
```

Create tidymodels workflow to combine the modeling components

```{r workflow}
incidents_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(recipe)
```

```{r nb-spec}
# specify model, method to fit
nb_spec <- naive_Bayes() %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>% #set modeling context
  set_engine("naivebayes") #method for fitting model

nb_spec
```

Now we are ready to add our model to the workflow and fit it to the training data

```{r fit-model}
nb_fit <- incidents_wf %>%
  add_model(nb_spec) %>%
  fit(data = incidents_train)
```
Next up is model evaluation. We can stretch our training data a little further and use resampled data sets built from the training set to evaluate our naive Bayes model. Here we create 10-fold cross-validation sets, and use them performance estimates.

```{r}
set.seed(234)
incidents_folds <- vfold_cv(incidents_train) #default is v = 10

incidents_folds
```

```{r nb-workflow}
nb_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(recipe) %>%
  add_model(nb_spec)

nb_wf
```

To estimate its performance, we fit the model many times, once to each of these resampled folds, and then evaluate on the heldout part of each resampled fold.

```{r fit-resamples}
nb_rs <- fit_resamples(
  nb_wf,
  incidents_folds,
  control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)
)
```

Extract the relevant information using collect_metrics() and collect_predictions() and examine the performance metrics.

```{r performance}
nb_rs_metrics <- collect_metrics(nb_rs) # area under the curve, accuracy measure
nb_rs_predictions <- collect_predictions(nb_rs)
nb_rs_metrics
# perfect score is one, so this has a decent accuracy at 0.735. 
```

We'll use two performance metrics: accuracy and ROC AUC.
Accuracy is the proportion of the data that is predicted correctly. 
The ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate; AUC closer to 1 indicates a better-performing model, while AUC closer to 0.5 indicates a model that does no better than random guessing.

```{r performance-plot}
nb_rs_predictions %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  roc_curve(truth = fatal, .pred_fatal) %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(
    "Resamples",
    title = "ROC curve for Climbing Incident Reports"
  )
```

Another model method involves the confusion matrix. A confusion matrix tabulates a model's false positives and false negatives for each class.

```{r confuction-matrix}
# average across all 10 model runs, 40 of fatal reports are classified non-fatal, biased towards non-fatal
#basyan classifier
conf_mat_resampled(nb_rs, tidy = FALSE) %>% #compute matrix for each fold then average
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```

```{r null-model}

null_classification <- null_model() %>%
  set_engine("parsnip") %>% #parsnip package
  set_mode("classification")

null_rs <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(recipe) %>%
  add_model(null_classification) %>%
  fit_resamples(
    incidents_folds
  )
```

Let's move up to a more sophisticated model. A lasso classification model uses regularization to help us choose a simpler, more generalizable model.  Variable selection helps us identify which features to include in our model.

Lasso classification learns how much of a penalty to put on features to reduce the high-dimensional space of original possible variables (tokens) for the final model.

```{r lasso-specification}
# penalty term downweights - set here to 0.01, less informative features are downweighted
#using general linear model, as it is a regression
lasso_spec <- logistic_reg(penalty = 0.01, mixture = 1) %>% #glm for binary outcomes
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  set_engine("glmnet") #estimation method for classification

lasso_spec
```

```{r lasso-workflow}
lasso_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(recipe) %>%
  add_model(lasso_spec)

lasso_wf
```

```{r fit-resamples-lasso}
set.seed(2020)

lasso_rs <- fit_resamples(
  lasso_wf,
  incidents_folds,
  control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)
)

#pull out metric and predictino
lasso_rs_metrics <- collect_metrics(lasso_rs)
lasso_rs_predictions <- collect_predictions(lasso_rs)

lasso_rs_metrics
# for each time train model, train on 9/10 of model
#accuracy - avg. accuracy; better accuracy with this than last time. 
```

```{r lasso-plot}
lasso_rs_predictions %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  roc_curve(truth = fatal, .pred_fatal) %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(
    color = "Resamples",
    title = "ROC curve for Climbing Incident Reports",
  )
```

```{r}
#confusion matrix
conf_mat_resampled(lasso_rs, tidy = FALSE) %>%
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```

The value penalty = 0.01 is a model hyperparameter. The higher it is, the more model coefficients are reduced (sometimes to 0, removing them -- feature selection) We set it manually before, but we can also estimate its best value, again by training many models on resampled data sets and examining their performance.

```{r penalty-tuning-specification}
tune_spec <- logistic_reg(penalty = tune(), mixture = 1) %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  set_engine("glmnet")

tune_spec
```

```{r}
# creating 30 different penalty values, which value yields the best performance
lambda_grid <- grid_regular(penalty(), levels = 30)
lambda_grid
```

Here we use grid_regular() to create 30 possible values for the regularization penalty. Then tune_grid() fits a model at each of those values.

PARALLELIZATION?

```{r tune}
tune_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(recipe) %>%
  add_model(tune_spec)

set.seed(2020)
tune_rs <- tune_grid(
  tune_wf,
  incidents_folds,
  grid = lambda_grid,  #penalty values
  control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)
)

tune_rs
```


```{r}

#
collect_metrics(tune_rs)
```

```{r plot_metrics}
# range of penalty values
# small values - no effect on the model, higher values effect model and make it better
# remove features that are not that valuable, then crashes off with over correction
# select range of penalty values to determine best value for model
autoplot(tune_rs) +
  labs(
    title = "Lasso model performance across regularization penalties"
  )
```

```{r penalty-show-best}
# show best penalty values
tune_rs %>%
  show_best("roc_auc")

# show best penalty values by accuracy measure 
tune_rs %>%
  show_best("accuracy")

# show best penalty value based on accuracy metric
chosen_acc <- tune_rs %>%
  select_by_one_std_err(metric = "accuracy", -penalty)

chosen_acc
```

Next, let's finalize our tunable workflow with this particular regularization penalty. This is the regularization penalty that our tuning results indicate give us the best model.

```{r final-model}
#rerun model with best penalty value (chosen_acc)
final_lasso <- finalize_workflow(tune_wf, chosen_acc)

final_lasso
```

The penalty argument value now reflects our tuning result. Now we fit to our training data.

```{r}
fitted_lasso <- fit(final_lasso, incidents_train)
```

First let's look at the words associated with an accident being non-fatal.

```{r words-non-fatal}
# top 10 words correlated with a non-fatal report, most telling for a report resulting in non-fatality
fitted_lasso %>%
  extract_fit_parsnip() %>%
  tidy() %>%
  arrange(-estimate)
```

And now the words that are most associated with a fatal incident.

```{r words-fatal}
# top 10 words correlated with a fatal report
fitted_lasso %>%
  extract_fit_parsnip() %>%
  tidy() %>%
  arrange(estimate)
```
